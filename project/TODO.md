* [x] build a feature selection process (use dependency-based feature elimination)
* [x] use synsets to build features
* [x] create a way to identify which feature pipelines are most important
    * [x] maybe a table to decode the pipeline in a CSV
* [x] try new similarity metrics
* [ ] look at [1995_Resnik_semantic-similarity.pdf](../references/1995_Resnik_semantic-similarity.pdf)
* [ ] standardize feature value ranges
