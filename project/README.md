# Na√Øve Semantic Similarity

## Overview

This project explores the use of various feature extraction methods and machine learning models to predict the similarity between sentence pairs.

A summary of the results can be found at the bottom of [`train_and_evaluate.ipynb`](./notebooks/train_and_evaluate.ipynb).

## How to Reproduce

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

Run [`extract_features.ipynb`](./notebooks/extract_features.ipynb) to extract features from the data.

---

Run [`train_and_evaluate.ipynb`](./notebooks/train_and_evaluate.ipynb) to train and evaluate the models.
