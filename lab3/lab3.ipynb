    "1. Read all pairs of sentences of the *SMTeuroparl* files of test set within the evaluation framework of the project.\n",
    "2. Compute their similarities by considering lemmas and Jaccard distance.\n",
    "3. Compare the results with those in session 2 (*document structure*) in which words were considered.\n",
    "4. Compare the results with gold standard by giving the pearson correlation between them.\n",
    "5. Questions (justify the answers):\n",

    "    - Which is better: words or lemmas?\n",
